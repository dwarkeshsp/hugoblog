Hi! I'm the host of the Lunar Society Podcast ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/DwarkeshPatel), [podcast platforms](https://anchor.fm/dwarkeshpatel)), where I interview economists, philosophers, and scientists about their big ideas.

Feel free to email me with comments, feedback, etc. at dwarkesh.sanjay.patel@gmail.com. Or you can DM me on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dwarkesh_sp).

I would love to meet you! Sign up for a Zoom meeting [here](https://calendly.com/dwarkesh/meet).
